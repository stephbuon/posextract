S3V0119P0_17437,"In order that he (Sir B. Hall) might not be charged with presumption, he would not rely upon his own words in addressing what was called the country party, but he would quote the language of one for whom that party once entertained the greatest respect, and of whom he was quite sure the Chancellor of the Exchequer entertained the very highest opinion."
S3V0308P0_7176,"It was clearly an accidental provision, and the right place to discuss that provision would have been when the Bill got into Committee."
S1V0040P0_914,"Some few years ago, the friends of the Roman Catholic claims thought it right, that, in return for the removal of all disabilities from the Roman Catholics, certain concessions should be made on their side, such as some interference of the Crown in the appointment of the Roman Catholic superior clergy, and some restrictions on the communications with the see of Rome, called the Veto, and the regium exequatur."

S3V0011P0_7514,"They added, that such addition was unnecessary for the purpose of forming a sufficient constituency, as there were about 500 houses worth 10 per annum in Stamford, and they concluded by praying that if the scot-and-lot franchise was to be annihilated, St. Martin's parish might not on that, or any other account, be added to the borough; and that if, in the opinion of the House, that addition should appear proper, then they prayed that, the borough might be wholly disfranchised, and the right of returning Members transferred to some of those important towns omitted in the Reform Bill, where the voters might not be exposed to similar persecution for the free exercise of the elective franchise."

S3V0135P0_15985,"Consequently, we could not accuse Russia of having in any way acted contrary to the spirit of the convention of 1815; and, therefore, we could not with honour have refused to continue the payments on account of the Russian-Dutch loan, in consequence of the occurrence of an event which Russia was willing to prevent, but which we approved, and which we desired Russia not to attempt to prevent, but, on the contrary, to assent to."
S4V0123P0_5169,"He desired also to know what progress had been made in facilitating communication between the lightships on the coast and the shore lighthouses, so that in the event of shipwreck instant communication could be obtained with the coastguard and lifeboat services."
S3V0137P0_1831,"This return clearly showed that the system of carrying horses by steam vessels was certainly to be preferred to that of sailing vessels; but when steam vessels could not be obtained, recourse must be had to sailing vessels, to comply with the exigencies of the service."

S3V0153P0_14485,"If not, then I must say I cannot blame the noble Lord for moving an Amendment, not to the second reading of the Bill, (for after that Amendment the Bill may be read a second time) but for moving such an Amendment as would constitute a declaration made by the House, that this question of the identity of the franchise is not to be considered as vital to the measure."

S3V0277P0_14947,"He would like to ask the Postmaster General if it was possible, under present arrangements, for private individuals to undertake telephone arrangements for the Metropolis?"
S3V0110P0_8397,The question of the waste lands was one of the deepest interest to the colonies.
S4V0195P0_12340,Now the situation in which they found themselves was this.
S3V0209P0_13408,"Friend (Mr. H. Cowper)—namely, that this was one of the first experiments in dealing with large basins for the supply of water."
S3V0008P0_1599,But the renting a 10 l. house is plainly a criterion both of property and respectability.
S2V0002P0_22501,"Those petitions stated the general commercial distress which prevailed, without pointing out any immediate remedy for that distress."
S4V0184P0_17969,Another limitation is that no area is to-get more than 6s.
S3V0103P0_21730,"The Bill was now greatly altered, and yet the House had never had a proper opportunity for discussing it."
S3V0311P0_28440,"When Parliament is asked to vote a sum of £150, 000 out of the pockets of the English taxpayer for the payment of people in Egypt, I think it is necessary to have some explanation of the purpose for which it has been employed, who will profit by it, and what is the nature of the services the Egyptian Government performed for which they are now seeking payment."
S3V0142P0_6165,"In the first instance, when the question was raised, Lord Clarendon said he could not agree to the possession by Russia in the Black Sea of such large vessels; and then the question was adjourned, as were many other questions which were raised before the Plenipotentiaries, and the consideration of which proved to be inconvenient."
S3V0281P0_23200,"When you leave the farm you will be paid the full value of your improvements; but until then you must pay, in the shape of rent, the full value of the farm. """""
S3V0017P0_4415,He would not take up the time of the Committee by referring to history for many instances.
S3V0063P0_23350,"Member proceeded to a division, he should certainly not divide with him."
S4V0193P0_602,"I have made some inquiry into this matter, and I find that there are schools in nearly every big port in this country where persons wishing to embrace the calling of the sea can study all matters connected with it."
S3V0145P0_9599,"Believing that it would lead to a great saving of expense, he should certainly make that proposition in the next Session, if he had a seat in the House."
S3V0331P0_3235,"I am informed that meetings have not taken place at this particular spot, at which the crowd stood across a route of omnibus traffic; but at a point further down White Lion Street, where no appreciable obstruction has been caused, and where the meeting in question would not have been interfered with."
S3V0056P0_3036,They often boasted of the wisdom of their ancestors.
S2V0002P0_11584,By the gentlemen of the princess's suite.
S5CV0014P0_17509,"Member for Waterford, this national Irish weapon, this shillelah, with which they propose to beat out the claims of all who stand in opposition to them in carrying out their autocratic will which they claim to have a mission from the country to put into effect; I think the trading community of the country will see perfectly plainly through these party tactics, which, as a new Member, I admit are frankly very confusing; but I think those outside who have not had to attend the Debates in this House, but have merely been able quietly in their own business places to read the reports of what has taken place, will perfectly understand the reason for these gigantic borrowing powers, and will understand that it is not a matter of Parliamentary practice which interests them at all, but that they had a right to believe that the best would be done with the time at the disposal of the House, and that the very first business would be collecting the greatest amount of revenue possible, and due at the present time."
S1V0011P0_4615,"He thought it was impossible that there could be any justification for it, and that it was a symptom of a general system to be adopted against the rights and against the feelings of the catholics of Ireland."
S3V0189P0_5145,"He attached so much importance to the recognition of the principle of an increase of the episcopacy that he trusted their Lordships would not offer any opposition, to Amendments which were not fatal to the principle."
S4V0040P0_5081,"THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD (Mr. HENRY CHAPLIN, Lincolnshire, Sleaford ) :"
S3V0215P0_26899,"The necessary number was, according to the Deputy Coroner's statement, completed after he was sworn."
S3V0086P0_18255,"On that occasion, a report was to be read for his information."
S3V0299P0_20154,"He had received a letter shortly after the meeting of the House purporting to be from the brother-in-law of the girl alleged to have been abducted, in which a denial was given to most of the statements made in the paragraph."
S4V0180P0_8378,But they must take care that the equipment was provided.
S3V0087P0_3734,"What he would recommend to the noble Duke (the Duke of Richmond) was, to withdraw his Amendment in the meantime, and wait to see the result of the measure of Government, and if the consequences should prove so disastrous as was anticipated, some arrangement of this kind might be proposed next year."
S4V0059P0_1791,He has himself told us that his calculation has been to some extent upset by the litigation he has referred to.
S4V0106P0_12030,This war has shown many things in the way of exhaustion.
S1V0041P0_10045,"Nay, more; the justice had it in his power to send one of his emissaries into the meeting who did not belong to the parish or district, one of the noble lord's spies for instance, whose presence or language might make the assembly illegal."
S3V0211P0_18617,"If the newspapers were to say that they could give no report, that would be intelligible."
S3V0225P0_8970,So much as regarded any fears which might be entertained on behalf of the landlords.
S3V0237P0_2082,"What he (the Earl of Airlie) wished to point out was that there was a wide difference between the two despatches, though he was bound to admit that there was considerable force in the reasons which the Foreign Secretary assigned for the advance in the position assumed by the Government in December."
S3V0076P0_16973,"But, as at present informed, it does not appear to me to be folly to lose one chance out of two of intercepting the slave-ships."
S2V0002P0_1037,"He should therefore presume that that bill was unalterable at present, and irrevocable till some future opportunity, and should argue for his illustrious client under the idea that he was confined to the manner of the proceedings, and the time or times in which those proceedings were to take place."
S3V0214P0_12895,"You will find in that Report that the number of recruits who failed on trial last year was less than 14 per 1, 000, which, in his opinion, is remarkably small, and shows that great attention is paid to the medical examination of recruits."
S4V0070P0_5668,"It is unfortunate, but the card, whether issued with or without the right honourable Gentleman's authority, was, at any rate, a summarised epitome, drawn up by skilled agents, who presumably had attended meetings and had heard the right honourable Gentleman's speeches."
S3V0304P0_17462,"In a matter of this kind men who have served the Queen in high offices of State, and who remained her Privy Councillors, ought not to treat the Irish nation with levity."
S3V0056P0_16484,"If in July Government had proposed to take a greater number of men, than was actually necessary, they would have given grounds for that excitement that subsequently had prevailed in France."
S4V0056P0_11599,Member's Motion is directed.
S3V0064P0_3216,"I shudder at the recollection and almost dread to tell your Lordships of some of the cases that have come to my knowledge—cases in which, however, and be this told to the honour of humanity, I have heard of the greatest benevolence and the kindest disposition being evinced by those having the smallest means, and who, I must say, are ever found endeavouring to alleviate the distresses of people but little poorer than themselves out of the proceeds of their own scanty pittance."
S4V0166P0_8547,Other Members in the House did that for them.
S4V0046P0_15078,"He hoped the House would pause well before condemning what had been done on this occasion, and he could not admit the alternative policy that had been offered to that of Her Majesty's Government, an alternative policy which would mean, if it meant anything, that we should abstain from all interference, and leave Turkey to suppress this insurrection according to her known and ordinary methods, by fire and sword, and by practices that to every civilised nation were infinitely worse even than lire and sword."
S3V0317P0_2822,"It was with the view not to criticize, not to interfere with the action of the Government, which, he thought, was worthy of praise, but with a view to help them and to bring public opinion to bear on this question that he brought forward this subject."
S5CV0017P0_18423,"Presented accordingly, and read the first time; to be read a second time upon Monday next."
S3V0277P0_12776,"The trustees would not be allowed to retain in their possession vast sums of money, nor would they be allowed to charge the estate with all manner of expenses."
S3V0023P0_3828,"You were wrong; you know it, and"
S3V0157P0_7971,"He says that we have a total of 4, 000, 000 acres, or, in round numbers, 6, 000 square miles, of coal in the British islands."
S3V0008P0_10525,What grounds were there for supposing that they would neglect their duty?
S3V0288P0_18714,"Gentleman would be in a position to carry out his will, even if he had the wish."
S3V0238P0_16812,"The result was, that when the gun came next to be fired, the charge, instead of leaving the gun by way of the muzzle, exploded in the contrary direction and killed several men, in addition to causing much confusion on board the ship."
S3V0013P0_13325,He trusted the House would never for one moment entertain such an argument.
S3V0252P0_26534,They always were exceptional when it was sought to make a bad precedent.
S3V0313P0_17725,"Now, I do not hesitate to affirm that if that trial had taken place in Ireland, no jury would have dared to bring in a verdict of guilty."
S3V0150P0_15617,Office and the Board of Control is a cause of the greatest mischief.
S3V0036P0_14308,"But when he gave his consent to advocate the measure, he gave it under the full conviction of the sacrifices with which it was to be accompanied, and under the full impression of retiring from office, and supporting the claims of the Catholics in private life."
S3V0092P0_1040,"I say, my Lords, that this is one of the causes and one of the greatest aggravations of the existing evils of Ireland; and the consequence is, that the Government has been obliged to come forward to give relief by employing large numbers of the labourers of the country upon public works."
S3V0272P0_6571,"In the one case, he calls money paid by the State a gift from the Public Exchequer; but in regard to the other he, I must say, very coolly, but no doubt with perfect sincerity, calls it money taken from the landlord."
S3V0222P0_7335,"Therefore, it was premature and irregular to give Notice of a Motion for the issue of a writ."
S4V0091P0_7701,"Gentleman, and the extreme slenderness of the base upon which these charges rest"
S3V0306P0_6490,It is to be borne in mind that these annual inspections are the occasions when the Asylums are officially visited by the Managers who are not on the Committees for the management of those Asylums.
S4V0060P0_417,"He said that the power of compulsory service was one with which he would not readily part, that it was one it was necessary to keep with a view to possible emergencies, and he added this most important statement, that the present law was antiquated and required revision."
S3V0154P0_6512,"Member for Carlisle put it aside on the ground that there was a Committee of inquiry into the Berwick election, when the whole subject would be investigated."
S3V0313P0_1463,I see no indication of an independent state of mind among them.
S1V0020P0_12869,"With respect to his motion, he still adhered to the opinions he had delivered."
S3V0124P0_2609,A general register had previously failed of its purpose.
S4V0083P0_14328,That he contended would inflict very grievous injustice.
S3V0217P0_16885,"Out of the 50, 000 accidents of all kinds that annually happened in this country, resulting in 29, 176 deaths, only 4, 346, resulting in 65 deaths, were referable to our textile manufacture; and he submitted that, so far as the allegation that textile manufactures were fraught with danger to women and children, they were, on the contrary, their best source of help and protection."
S3V0142P0_7289,"If a rate of 4 d. or 6 in the pound were laid over the entire county, those parishes that were assessed at only 60 or 70 per cent of the value, paid a smaller percentage than those who were assessed at 80 or 90 per cent of their value."
S4V0059P0_4816,The scheme he proposed was really a scheme in competition with the Attorney General.
S3V0124P0_2951,But then his noble and learned Friend said that the persons in possession of property would derive no advantage from the registration in point of security.
S4V0196P0_6425,"They wanted the Board to represent the trade of London, and he agreed that there ought not to be such a number of external elements as would imperil the efficiency of the Board as a whole."
S4V0047P0_14775,"Gentleman whether the Land Commissioners report that the particulars in the schedule """"are procurable"""" at the same time as the announcement of the fair rent?"
S5CV0009P0_7097,The principle of the tax is simply that the person who has got this value at his disposition ought to pay something out of it.
S3V0064P0_8073,"The population, too, of these separated states by difference of creed and caste, were prevented from combining and communicating with each other."
S4V0107P0_15056,I find no safeguard in the Bill that this additional subvention which is to come out of the rates will not to a considerable extent go in relief of existing subscriptions.
S3V0283P0_2256,"He even accused the Government of some Machiavellian design in bringing up the Bill late in the Session, and, assuming that he knew much better than they did themselves how to manage their Business, he complained that they had not accelerated its progress by a single day, and had postponed it to the Parliamentary Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Bill."
S3V0014P0_9495,"Gentlemen now move for papers, whose uniform argument, on the two first discussions, had been founded on the treaty itself, with a stout denial that any thing extraneous could throw light upon it?"
S3V0061P0_11373,Gentleman said the Income-tax ought never to be imposed except under the pressure of war.
S4V0012P0_20213,"Certain specimens were some years ago removed from the collection as being useless or unsuitable for exhibition, and some of these have, no doubt, deteriorated."
S5LV0004P0_10563,On conveyance on transfers by voluntary disposition the fixed duty is ten per cent.
S3V0080P0_15819,"Friend will consent either to withdraw his Bill, or that he will not be satisfied to have it met with a negative, because any expectation that the Government might alter their views on this subject must prove utterly fallacious."
S3V0325P0_22899,"Amendment proposed, in page 4, line 6, after the words """"town clerk"""" to insert the words """"of county fund for borough fund."
S3V0323P0_1312,The noble Marquess might scarcely be aware of the enormous interests concerned in this question.
S4V0072P0_861,"I have put in these recommendations exactly as they stand in the report, but the general opinion now is that the Academicians should be limited to still fewer works, but that at any rate they should pass a competent jury and not send in pictures which are really of no value."
S3V0019P0_5386,"As to the statement of 100, 000 ."
S4V0195P0_21135,Gentleman justify such a proposal?
S3V0241P0_6924,These things caused the Government to consider the steps they proposed to take with all the greater confidence.
S3V0171P0_8330,He supported this clause in the interests of peace.
S4V0050P0_7925,"It was bound by Statute to obey the orders of the Treasury in what it did, but the conception of the kind of obedience which the Department held itself bound to render was to him a strange and new conception."
S1V0031P0_11751,"He must say, that out of regard to public morals, they ought to withhold that sanction if the connexion was such as the Queen had refused to approve, which refusal they were justified in inferring."
S3V0277P0_6204,"There presented themselves 11, 032, or 94 per cent."
S3V0205P0_1585,"If it was the intention of the Commissioners to say that hereafter poverty should not be considered, their scheme ought to be denounced most absolutely."
S3V0146P0_1500,"The forces which he mentioned as being gathered together by General An son before Delhi, will be met by the English troops which have been despatched from the hills to join him; they will also be met by the troops of the Native princes, who have shown a most cordial and praiseworthy desire of co-operating with the British troops—and I think that this is a very important circumstance, not only from the material advantage of their assistance, but also as showing the opinion which prevails in India as to the result of such a contest."
S3V0128P0_5026,"The only ground on which the issue of the writ could be contested was, that the Committee had reported that bribery had existed; but all they reported upon that head was, that a person was promised the amount of an outstanding election account if he refrained from giving his vote; but that promise, the Committee said, was not proved to have been made with the knowledge or consent of Mr. Towneley, the Member."
S4V0063P0_7015,The right honourable Gentleman must be referring to the Indian Act.
S3V0057P0_10639,"Gentleman was one of a strictly practical nature, the course which the discussion had taken had brought before the House great principles which were involved in the consideration of the subject."
S3V0114P0_4900,There was one expression in the Speech in which he certainly could not agree.
S3V0311P0_2012,"The price of land might go up, and it would be a most serious thing for the Church that the glebe lands should be sold during the current agricultural distress."
S3V0047P0_5230,They were to march against their own countrymen who had been designated as aliens and as outcasts.
S4V0012P0_25795,The Board of Supervision had too many lawyers among its members; and it was for the Secretary for Scotland to prevail upon his Colleagues to bring about such reforms as were demanded.
S5CV0005P0_5583,"Then they go on for another fortnight, and perhaps they want £2, 000 each week during the whole of the 12 months."
S3V0045P0_11879,"He had already stated, that it would be impracticable to ask Parliament for any great increase of the funds of the Church until the question of cathedral preferments was examined into, and any surplus they could afford to spare was ascertained."
S3V0162P0_15698,He could see but two possible objects.
S3V0329P0_2811,Gentleman's speech that the sentiments of Gentlemen on this side of the House are generally to be inferred from a suggestion to which he had given the great weight of his personal authority.
S3V0145P0_23276,Gentlemen opposite certainly hail led him to expect other things from them.
S3V0083P0_4767,He should support the vote.
S4V0088P0_1600,"Gentleman there are found men who honestly think that the war was an unjust war, and that even now the independence of these Republics, unjustly assailed, should be restored to them, and who, therefore, not from want of patriotism, but from motives sufficient in their own mind to justify their conduct, would be regarded, and rightly regarded, by the Boers and their leaders as people anxious to support and aid them?"
S3V0051P0_7005,"The defendant was justified in law in that publication, without resorting to the plea of the privilege of Parliament."
S4V0101P0_11060,"The whole of my contention is that we must protect property and protect liberty, and the bolder we are in our conduct in doing that the more likely we are to win success."
S3V0172P0_8732,He said the noble Lord's greatest claim to the popularity he enjoyed with the country was founded upon this scheme of fortifications.
S3V0343P0_5211,"Member for the Maldon Division (Mr. Gray) has spoken with a vigour and independence which Her Majesty's Government are ready to honour and value; but though he made several suggestions as to the direction in which this Bill might be improved, he spoke generally in favour of it."
S2V0006P0_1542,"During the consultation, one advised on thing, another another, and the dissention thus generated amongst themselves, became at length so boisterous, that the patient desired his servant to turn them all out of doors, and leave him to himself."
S3V0322P0_8192,It had been carried out in order to enable the landlords to get in their rents; but he (Mr. Clancy) was afraid the result would not be beneficial in that direction.
S4V0183P0_5575,"They were not doing anything useful, but they were doing the public out of a good deal."
S3V0139P0_8069,"They reported to the House that """"the business of such Companies differed so much from ordinary business that it was advisable to repeal all the provisions of the Joint-stock Companies Act so far as they related to Assurance Societies, and to deal with them in a separate Act. """""
S3V0320P0_24022,Gentleman to page 210 of the 2nd volume of the discussions at the Colonial Conference.
S3V0117P0_4109,This court was conducted with all the solemnity of a court-martial.
S3V0042P0_5114,He then put every obstacle in the way of the public enjoying the right—
S5CV0009P0_7425,"You ex elude the common rights, and thereby you reduce the valuation."
S4V0020P0_12469,"His answer was that the Guardians should have the same qualification as the District Councillors, and he pointed out that the whole scheme of this part of the Bill would be broken down if the Amendment were accepted."
S2V0012P0_13461,He did not support this measure because it was a profitable thing to those by whom it had been projected.
S3V0329P0_4797,"Member asking that all the Prison Rules should be laid on the Table of the House, and he had not the slightest objection to doing so."
S3V0290P0_12086,He could hardly think that that was a stop which the House could contemplate with any sense of justice.
S3V0277P0_13898,"But the contract, as I said, has no force at all until it has been approved by the House."
S4V0053P0_17420,The County Council will have a veto upon the presentments for district roads in rural area.
S3V0325P0_23462,It was that this power of enabling a person to give evidence on his own behalf was in the interest of the accused.
S3V0024P0_1040,"He had always remarked, both with reference to that and to the other House, that when a case was fully made out for any measure, which its opponents could not overturn by fair reasoning and just argument, they immediately appointed a Committee, as the best way of getting rid of it."
S3V0157P0_27889,I am speaking of the special alliance which exists.
S3V0092P0_12343,"He apprehended that that company got into great difficulties; and if they had not had the power of raising new shares, they could never have proceeded with the works."
S3V0326P0_9937,In the last few weeks news had arrived that we had actually extended our Protectorate in some form or other to Bechuanaland.
S4V0037P0_22403,The companies wanted more and tried to get all they could and grants to the extent mentioned had been made.
S4V0109P0_14112,That machinery was the abomination of those days.
S4V0082P0_17993,"I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention has been called to the outbreak of scurvy on the British sailing ship """"Beacon Rock, """" of Glasgow, whilst on a voyage from London to San Francisco in 1899; whether he is aware that Enoch Oleman, one of the sailors, was put into hospital at San Francisco suffering from the malady, and that the crew allege as the cause of the scurvy that the beef, flour, and water supplied to them were unfit for human consumption; whether he can explain why Enoch Oleman did not receive his wages due to him up to the time of his discharge at San Francisco; and whether he is aware that the scale of provisions supplied to the men is the same as was issued in 1850."
S3V0290P0_11331,"Baronet has made three distinct statements, as far as I understand him."
S3V0039P0_682,"And when Mr. Peel spoke of the """"extension of education, """" as another part of the remedy to be applied to Ireland, I take it for granted that he meant the extension of such a system of education as should be applicable to the great mass of the people."
S3V0178P0_16297,But for the purpose I have in view it will do just as well to take this account; and the result is of great interest.
S3V0095P0_19968,"Member for East Surrey (Mr. H. Drummond),"
S3V0221P0_3963,"From first to last, it was, as a judicial Court, a fiction."
S2V0009P0_12597,The harvest of the present year promised to be very late.
S3V0174P0_21559,"And I may say that even in that particular there has been no want of attention to the principle of assimilation recommended by the Commissioners, because while here in England the Masters generally were abolished, the Master in Lunacy continued to act,"
S4V0067P0_8519,"They have failed to do so, and until they give some satisfactory answer to the questions that have been asked to-night by the right honourable Baronet the Member for the Forest of Dean, and by the right honourable Gentleman the late Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, it does seem to me that the House should not vote these large sums of money for these wild districts and swampy marshes in Central Africa which, at the very best, are only speculative investments for this country."
S4V0101P0_10756,"The probable reason of the savings in Ireland was that the people were putting by in order to emigrate, or to make provision for a day of emergency and suffering, which they feared was only too likely to come upon them."
S3V0220P0_3978,No amount of repressive laws would change the habits and tastes of the great body of the people.
S3V0155P0_15719,He did not consider there was anything in this which was inconsistent with the clause in the Act transferring the Government of India.
S4V0126P0_5800,"I think, so far as it went, it was a very good agreement."
S5CV0008P0_3624,"When it comes to so fine a point as that, that a man of the political position of the late Duke of Devonshire may, without violating the Sessional Order, speak on the day before the nomination—"
S4V0015P0_808,"Instead of vast improvements, such as a now thoroughfare from the Strand to Holborn, the proposal was now confined to the rebuilding of Vauxhall Bridge and to making approaches to Woolwich Ferry and the new Tower Bridge."
S4V0030P0_2709,But there was a way out of the difficulty.
S3V0117P0_9457,"Why find the penalty in statutable misdemeanors, punishable by fines and imprisonment?"
S3V0293P0_19997,He recollected what occurred at the close of the Sitting at the end of the Summer Session.
S3V0146P0_16258,"I do not think that in our debates at this moment, we ought to go into the ancient history of Ireland, or that we ought to discuss the character of the office at the time of the Union or before the Union, but we may speak of the action and influence of this office as we know it in our own times and in our own experience."
S3V0183P0_22360,"If that doctrine were to be laid down in the present state of Parliament since the lie-form of Parliament in 1832, I maintain that it would be utterly impossible for any Government, unless it were far wiser than any that has yet existed, to carry on for twelve months the administration of the affairs in this House."

S3V0233P0_10152,"He expected he should be met by the statement that he was making a personal attack, and that it was ungenerous of him to bring the matter before the House; but this was not of the nature of a personal attack, and sympathy with Sir Henry Elliot's state of health — a sympathy which he (Mr. Rylands) himself felt—ought not to prevent the House discussing the important considerations dependent on his position at Constantinople."
S4V0059P0_10612,"The """"poor"""" people who are getting £400 a year from their land, which they do not work for, have only to pay half their land tax; the other class, who have to work, and who are getting twelve or fourteen shillings a week, will not get the advantages."
S3V0055P0_2833,"The deans and chapters looked on the measure as a sort of imputation on them that they had neg- lected their duty; but while this strong feeling against the bill existed on the part of the clergy, it at the same time rendered them not the best judges as to the matter in question."
S3V0157P0_24452,"He (Mr. Sheridan) was of opinion the difference would be in amount almost equal to that given away by the repeal of the paper duty, if not a great deal more."

S3V0326P0_22014,"To impute to the Opposition a design to defeat the measure was, in the circumstances, likely to engender a suspicion that the Government would themselves regard its defeat with equanimity."

S3V0312P0_18567,"It was in their hands that the ultimate power of this country lay, and they knew that those people regarded repressive legislation with the greatest dislike, and disapproved exceptional legislation for one part of the United Kingdom, because they thought the same laws ought to prevail in England, Scotland, and Ireland."

S3V0072P0_2490,"He was no lawyer; and if he were, he should not presume to discuss this part of the question; but he must say that the Government had been the most unfortunate Government that ever were in the world."
S3V0281P0_22003,"They had Gentlemen from the Admiralty coming down and asking them to give £280 for each boy on board the Britannia , when everyone knew that the education in schools of this kind could be done for £70 or £80 per head."

S3V0067P0_16169,"The present expenditure was altogether unjustified; we were running riot in our poverty; and the only remedy to which he could look with any hopeful anticipations, was a finance committee to inquire into and check our expenditure."

S4V0060P0_10288,"I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention has been called to the death of Thomas Sargeant, aged 15, from """"gassing"""" by benzol, in the Whitwood Chemical Works, at Normanton, about a fortnight ago, and to the circumstances attending the inquest; whether there were no regulations controlling the manufacture or use of benzol; and, if so, whether the desirability of instituting some regulations will be considered; and whether, seeing that the coroner has upon previous occasions dismissed applications for inquiry into matters having the gravest re any action can be taken on his refusal to institute a medical examination into so serious a misadventure?"
S3V0046P0_2033,"He knew of his own knowledge, that in the counties which had been referred to, many of the women were engaged in the manufacture of lace, and he believed, that they were paid by a system of truck—that is, that the grocers and others who took the lace obliged the women to take in exchange their own goods, some of which they might not require, and he did not see how the remedies which had been passed could be applied by these women."
S4V0048P0_22312,"In the associations very little difficulty has been found under that head, and I think that under our Bill very little difficulty will be found either."
S2V0007P0_21736,"Another argument in support of, the present measure, was, the mode in which the, power had been uniformly exercised."
S3V0288P0_13866,"He would say, as one of the loyal minority, that they would be able, in Ulster, to take care of themselves in the future as they had in the past; and he believed that when the crisis came in Ireland, under this Franchise Bill they would not be without their fair representation in that House."

S3V0169P0_782,He could not return to this country.
S3V0126P0_15380,"Would they not support the Resolution they had come to, and show the country that they would maintain the purity of election?"
S4V0043P0_1606,"Again he asked, why did the Sub-Commissioners make these vast reductions of rent?"
S4V0142P0_8933,"What they did as regards the Reserve now would not operate for a considerable time, but when it did operate it would be quite beyond their control to alter it."
S3V0250P0_13883,There are people who think that that would not be any great calamity; but if there be a good many Protestants in Ireland and a good many Conservatives I hope they will always find a sufficient representation in this House.
S4V0126P0_18079,He had not heard any real justification brought forward for this change.
S3V0315P0_17210,I can assure the Committee—and I have had some experience of official life—that the public officers are only too glad to make experiments and to attempt reforms which are called for by increasing business.
S4V0142P0_16652,"Personally, he cordially welcomed the reduction in the Naval Votes, having always striven, to the best of his ability, to place some curb upon the constant advance in naval and military expenditure, but he would like to be satisfied that it was a real reduction, based upon policy, which would entail further or consequential reductions in years to come."
S3V0100P0_971,"Now, no one was more inclined to pay the greatest deference and respect to the opinions of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland than he was—he only wished their Lordships had paid more deference to those opinions at a time when that body represented a larger portion of the people of Scotland than it did at present, and when its opinions were peculiarly valuable; but he felt bound to say that, considering the objections which the Assembly had brought against the present Bill, and looking to the specific reasons on which those objections were founded, he regarded them as quite untenable."
S3V0133P0_13540,"In the year 1846, the noble Lord declared, much to the gratification as well as surprise of the Roman Catholic Members of that House, that it was perfectly absurd to refuse to Roman Catholic bishops the assumption of any titles or jurisdiction over any districts which they might be pleased to adopt."
S3V0341P0_21511,"The Local Government Board, in the event of formal complaint being made to them under Section 299 of the Public Health Act that the Sanitary Authority have failed to provide their district with sufficient sewers or with an adequate supply of water, can direct a local inquiry on the subject; and if the complaint is substantiated can issue an order limiting the time within which the Sanitary Authority shall discharge their duty."
S4V0076P0_2957,He trusted that the noble Lord would find some relief for what was seriously complained of.
S3V0243P0_8955,But perhaps the gallant Admiral has not read these Papers.
S4V0110P0_4687,"That was, as will be admitted, a very large increase."
S3V0038P0_10325,"Considering that the tenant now pays the county rate, which in many instances has been doubled during the continuance of the existing leases—that he also pays the tithe, and that many tenants are left, after the payment of their rent, but a very inadequate sustenance, I do not think this an unreasonable apportionment of the burthen between landlord and tenant."
S3V0007P0_11136,That was a system of glaring absurdity.
S3V0229P0_4328,"Being unable to refer to the latest information which had been collected, he must avail himself of the Report, published in 1867 by Admiral Ryder, as Chairman of the Committee of the Society for Improving the Condition of Merchant Seamen."

S3V0153P0_26067,"In December, 1857, Sir W.

S3V0315P0_23767,I think it most unreasonable for the right hon. and learned Gentleman to refer to what was done in the Judicature Act.
S3V0119P0_10403,He agreed with the noble Lord (Viscount Melgund) in much of what he had said as to the Tests for parochial schoolmasters; but that was a subject for another Bill and another discussion.

S4V0034P0_7872,They respected their opinions and were thankful that they enjoyed endowments.
S3V0044P0_14650,"I say that I make this proposition with reluctance, because, I feel that if we were at any other period of the Session, that if the House were not utterly exhausted by the labours of this protracted Session, that if the attendance of Members were not at present so much reduced in numbers as to render it impossible to expect such an expression of the opinion of the House as would carry due weight with respect to a large measure of, this importance, I certainly should have thought, after the comments that have been made—after the doubts that have been expressed—that it would have been proper to introduce into this bill some other and additional clause in order to make clear what were the intentions of the Legislature with regard to the affairs of Canada."
S3V0131P0_1584,Even thither no missionary is permitted to go; and to this hour we believe that no mission has been sent from the Greek Church to supply the places of the expelled foreigners.
S5CV0014P0_26720,"Seldom has a voice been raised in these Debates, now occurring for many years, which attempted to defend the administration of the Congo, and which did not give support to the Government's Foreign Ministers in their representations and in their efforts to accomplish what was desired by this Parliament."
S3V0176P0_244,"My Lords, a short time ago I had the honour to inform your Lordships that in all probability in a few days I should have to announce to you that the Conference had agreed to the bases preliminary to a peace; or, upon the other hand, that the object of the negotiations had failed, and that war would be renewed on the termination of an armistice."
S3V0288P0_2120,"Are the Government satisfied that the person described as """"young Waller"""" ever had firearms?"
S5CV0001P0_18363,"Is he going to follow the precedent which I suggest he ought to follow of allocating a specific sum in the proportion I suggest, which was the proportion followed for many years by this House to the Irish Local Government Board, or is he going to set aside the specific enactment of 1905, constituting the Irish Local Government Board the authority, and is he going to put the Irish Local Government Board under the thumb of a Treasury clerk in Whitehall and compel them to apply to him for something which they know to be of pressing necessity?"
S5CV0015P0_7311,"The Noble Lord the Member for Portsmouth (Lord Charles Beresford) suggested that the real remedy for all our defects and shortcomings would be a War Staff, but there is a War Staff already."

S1V0035P0_13503,"He was aware it might be urged, that this was calling the chancellor to be judge in his own cause, and that many of the fees of the court appertained to himself."
S3V0051P0_10717,"But apart from the great principles to which he had alluded, he would turn for a moment to other subjects on which the interests of the community were much concerned, and would inquire whether upon those subjects the Ministry deserved the support of the Liberal Members of the House."

S3V0057P0_13020,There was one point to which he wished to address a few remarks.
S3V0008P0_10165,"He would at present, however, content himself with moving, """"That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty, that he will be graciously pleased to give directions that there be laid before this House, copies or extracts of such information as may have been conveyed to his Majesty by the Cabinet of Russia, and by the accredited agents of the late de facto government of Poland, concerning the cause of the war which has been waged in the latter country; also shewing how far neutrality appears to have been preserved by the States bordering on Poland, especially Prussia; also, of such mediation between the belligerents as may have been adopted, contemplated, or proposed, by his Majesty's ally the king of the French, in conjunction or otherwise; and of the assurances (if any), which may have been conveyed to his Majesty by the emperor, of Russia, whether before or since the capture of Warsaw, in respect to the just observance in future of the constitutional rights, nationality and independence of the kingdom of Poland, as guaranteed by the Treaty of Congress of Vienna, and other diplomatic acts of that period.

S4V0157P0_4879,It is quite true that they stated that it had been represented to them that the salaries of the clerical staff of the two Departments were fixed at a lower rate than in certain other Departments but they did not understand that the question of remuneration had been specifically referred to them and they confined themselves to pointing out that these inequalities had been brought to their notice.
S3V0039P0_19808,"The governor, in his speech, officially communicated the resolutions which had been agreed to by the Imperial Parliament, informed the House of Assembly that the demise of the Crown would make no alteration in the councils of the Ministry, and concluded by asking for a vote of money to pay the salaries of the officials."
S3V0299P0_3522,"The right hon. and gallant Admiral (Sir John Hay), who had just spoken, had remarked upon the composition of Sir Anthony Hoskins's Squadron; and he must say that with those remarks he sympathized in the largest and deepest manner."

S2V0015P0_2473,"That committee would probably have looked less to the past than to the future, and would have bounded its inquiries to the practical question of what system would deserve the support of parliament."
S3V0102P0_18932,"You vote millions here as if they were nothing, or as if every country was a California, and that gold was not produced in this country by the sweat of millions of men, who are entitled to as just and merciful a consideration of their interests as the highest and wealthiest man in Parliament."

S3V0279P0_17,Various remedies had been devised for this state of things.
S4V0002P0_110,"Clause 6 provides, amongst other things, for rules to be made as to the place of holding Courts; but this might be satisfied by regulations intended for the greater convenience of trial where no question of jurisdiction can be involved; and to avoid any such question I shall propose to move, in terms similar to those of the Bill of last year, that """"subject to rules the provincial court in each province may be held in the administrative County of London, or in such place as the Judge may direct.

S3V0211P0_6631,"Among those failures who are bent on obtaining this right for their sex, are many of our deepest thinkers and our most brilliant writers; are women who, as mothers and heads of families, are models of domestic excellence—are women whom this pursuit does not divest of the delicacy and sensitiveness which are quite compatible with vigour of mind and energy of purpose."
S1V0024P0_7389,"I also refer to what passed in Ireland a few years ago on the subject of the Veto, or approbation of the crown, proposed to be exercised by it upon the nomination and selection of the Roman Catholic bishops of that part of the empire; on which occasion, after much disgraceful shifting and tergiversation, on the part of the Roman Catholic bishops, the laity, at last, implicitly submitted to the fiat of their clergy; when reason, justice, policy, and the constant undisputed practice, in all the other countries of Europe, Catholic or non-Catholic, were unequivocally on their side."
S3V0126P0_1053,The effect of that was a power given to the Crown to make this a perpetual provision—out of what?
S4V0046P0_14163,"I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that steerage passengers landing from British bound American liners at Queenstown are cross-examined by the Royal Irish Constabulary as to their names, occupations, American addresses, destinations in Ireland, length of their proposed stay, the names of those they are going to visit, address, etc. , and that passengers embarking at Queenstown are obliged to show their tickets to detective officers going on board; whether he is aware that this practice is generally complained of by tourists, and is seriously injuring the Irish tourist traffic because, in consequence of it, tourists prefer to land in and embark from British ports; and whether he will confine this action of the police to persons whom they may reasonably suspect of the commission of crime or intention to commit crime?"
S4V0116P0_18952,The First Lord of the Treasury referred to the case of the clergyman who tried to compel the schoolmaster to teach that the doctrine of the Church of England is that there were seven sacraments.
S3V0163P0_11563,"I somewhat doubt whether it is at present ripe for such a change; but when it has acquired sufficient importance, no doubt the district will be better administered in that way than it is at present."
S1V00050_131,"At the same rate we may reckon that the combined Toulon and Cadiz fleet, of 18 sail of the line, and 5 frigates, carried out 8 or 9000 men; and that the second Rochefort squadron, of 3 sail of the line, besides frigates, had 1500 men on board."
S3V0097P0_842,"He would, however, in the first instance, call their attention to the fact, that by far the largest proportion of the expenditure of the country arose from obligations which they were bound to meet, if they desired to maintain the public faith; and that it was on a comparatively small amount of the public expenditure that they could attempt to effect any reduction, or to exercise economy."
S4V0079P0_22695,"Before I sit down, I should like some explanation as to why it was found necessary to remove the training ship """"Ganges"""" from Falmouth to Harwich, rather than move a ship from Plymouth."
S4V0160P0_16969,Since they had interfered with the Scottish education system by the attempt to differentiate between so-called secondary and elementary education the English influence upon Scottish education had been altogether for the bad.
S3V0319P0_30205,Members had to ask themselves was it likely they would succeed in the object they had in view?
S3V0326P0_24475,"The date of the last sitting at which cases from the Ballycastle Union were heard was July, 1887."
S3V0251P0_12229,"The best years of his life, from the beginning of railways till now, had been spent in railway work."
S5CV0015P0_21204,Does anyone doubt that the House of Commons would have passed our Education Act and our Licensing Act three times if it had been necessary?
S3V0333P0_25676,"I beg to ask the First Commissioner of Works, whether it is true, as stated in the Glasgow Evening News , that the Board of Works has sanctioned a scheme for the restoration of Dumblane Cathedral, that """"the Cathedral has been, or is to be, conveyed from the Board of Works to the Board of Manufactures"""" in Edinburgh, and that the Board has been entrusted with the selection of plans, and is to undertake, after the restoration, to maintain the fabric in all time coming, in consideration of a cash payment of £3, 000; if the statement be true, under what Act do the Commissioners of Works propose to hand over the control of an important National Monument to the Board of Manufactures; whether, considering that the interior of the ruined Cathedral has been used as a burial ground for more than a century, he has made any arrangement for safeguarding the burial rights of families interested in connection with the proposed restoration; and whether an opportunity will be given the House of discussing the proposed transfer of this national monument to the Board of Manufactures, a body which many consider not at all a proper body to be entrusted with this work?"
S4V0034P0_24651,Personally he hoped that none of the recommendations of the Committee would be lost sight of and he joined with those who regarded this Bill merely as an instalment.
S4V0082P0_8345,I remember hearing from a personal friend of mine an instance in which an estate was increased in value in this particular way.
S4V0109P0_10357,The fact that the illegality was endorsed by a resolution passed by a public Board does not make it any the less reprehensible.
S3V0305P0_488,What is to prevent their shutting up their shops every Sunday if they wish to do so?
S3V0108P0_3029,"If a man had 20 s. to expend in improvements, and if they deprived him of 19 of the amount, was it not clear that the remaining shilling must produce less effect than if they had left the 20 to the person?"
S3V0191P0_17570,But I cannot think that this is likely to be the effect of their teaching on the general mind.
S3V0096P0_9409,"Prelate that such a proposition deposed James II. , and that it was inserted in the Bill of Rights as one of the crimes brought against that monarch."
S3V0082P0_14993,Gentleman says he deeply regrets the limited amount.
S4V0131P0_1730,"Then in France, as is well known, at Nancy they have an admirable forestry school."
S3V0339P0_20580,"As I understand, the police did not consider that there was the slightest suspicion of foul play, although under the circumstances of the death they were anxious that an inquest should be held."
S3V0037P0_6335,"There might, perhaps, be a surplus, and that surplus might be applied to most useful purposes, without injury to the rights of any person."
S3V0226P0_11154,"He was in communication with the visiting justices as to what should be done with the boy, and he should be disposed to act upon their recommendations as to his release after a certain period."
S4V0119P0_5359,"In saying that I wish, in justice to the members of that department, to add that too much, as I think—though I do not wish to anticipate the Report of the Royal Commission—has been made of our absence of intelligence before the war."
S3V0050P0_5937,"Whatever course Ministers thought proper to pursue, it was essential that there should be a distinct understanding upon the subject."
S3V0230P0_16795,Gentleman then proceeded to state that the Church maintained these schools without any unfair influence being exerted on the children sent there.
S3V0088P0_2379,"Therefore, if they were to have 30, 000 or 40, 000 additional slaves imported into Cuba and Brazil, it must be by an additional expense, not only of the liberty of these 30, 000 or 40, 000 human beings, but of the lives of some 60, 000 or 80, 000 who would be hurried into eternity, or exposed to the most cruel torture."
S3V0061P0_40,"They would, however, continue to watch the progress of events, and if it was in the power of her Majesty's Government to assist the Spanish government, either as regarded the proceedings on the French frontier, or on the coast, or in any other manner that could be pointed out, the noble Earl might rely upon it, that her Majesty's Government would do everything to assist the present Spanish government in resisting any attacks that might be made on it."
S3V0176P0_7668,"Wherever there was a Catholic patron of a school, and they were usually the Catholic clergy,"
S4V0070P0_8036,"The real grievance was that here was property which was held in behoof of the parish as a whole, but the use of which was being applied now by a mere section of the community—namely, those who belonged to the Church of Scotland as a religious denomination."
S3V0194P0_24961,"The Rev. Mr. Sadler, a clergyman of the Church of England, who has written a very able pamphlet upon this subject, and in whose views I may say I almost if not altogether agree, has given a table of the Protestant Episcopal population of forty-four parishes, merely as examples, and many more might be found."
S3V0087P0_6461,"If it is pressed to a division, I cannot oppose it; if it is rejected, I shall not therefore recede from the proposition I have made on the part of the Government; and I shall be quite prepared to sustain, in argument, the advantages of the clauses as they now stand."
S3V0222P0_14124,"It amounted to this—that in spite of all that they heard about agricultural improvements, and in spite of the kind things done by the clergyman, the country gentleman, and the farmer, the labourers in the most important of all industries were in a condition of such deplorable poverty that the minds of their children must be sacrificed to premature toil, and that intellect blighted which was the noblest work of God."
S3V0180P0_9098,"Gentleman (Mr. Childers), the case would be fairly considered by the Government, and that the House would be spared the necessity of dividing on the clause, on the understanding that Sir Richard Bromley's legal rights, whatever they were, would be preserved to him."
S3V0233P0_23548,"Again, it is urged that Members would speak against time, and prose away in the House for the purpose of obtaining publicity."
S3V0132P0_17619,"The anchorage, he was told, was extremely easy; the wind never blew home, and, indeed, he believed that it was perfectly capable of being made into a naval station quite as good as Sebastopol."
S3V0056P0_17554,"But that the Roman Catholic hierarchy privately stated this plan to the Government, and proposed a system, to be under their exclusive control, and purchased the assent of Government to their proposition, by presenting an address to the Crown against Defenderism."
S2V0022P0_9198,He was aware that a distinction was attempted to be set up in this respect between officers on half-pay and officers on full-pay; but he considered it to be unfair and untenable.
S3V0345P0_6872,"It is not a Teacher's Code, it is an Inspector's Code, and as such is elastic and expansive."
S5LV0006P0_3314,"Meanwhile, why on earth should we be afraid of expressing our opinion, more especially when we have been told that this is not a Party question?"
S4V0126P0_428,"I do not say that these expressions, as far as we have gone into the inquiry, are eminently misleading, but they do justify the scepticism of some who doubt whether any inquiry in the ordinary sense of the word is progressing at all."
S5CV0012P0_14819,I do not think he need fear disaster.
S4V0028P0_10797,"Gentleman gave the number as 7, 000 or 8, 000."
S3V0241P0_18185,"This measure was a rating Bill, and the insertion of the proposed clause would convert it into a Turnpike Bill."
S3V0220P0_4271,"When Mr. Herbert equalized the price of Army Commissions, he proposed, and had the assent of the Horse Guards to the propositions, first that Cavalry Officers who had exchanged to Infantry or with a half-pay Infantry Officer and received the difference should not, as previously, be required to repay the difference before they could be appointed Colonels of Cavalry Regiments, but that in lieu of such repayment they should only receive the pay of an Infantry Colonelcy on appointment to a Cavalry Regiment as Colonel; secondly, that these who had paid the old Cavalry rate for their Field Officers' Commissions should be allowed the Cavalry rate of Colonel's pay; thirdly that these who had not paid the old rates should receive Infantry rates of pay."
S3V0200P0_21700,"Gentleman (Mr. Chichester Fortescue) by a large majority, in effect rescinding an Address to the Crown of an exactly opposite character, which had been carried a few nights previously by a majority of 10, in a House of over 200 Members."
S3V0136P0_6736,"And here he would mention, in passing—for he could not refrain from doing so—"
S4V0070P0_15172,He put it to honourable Members opposite whether he had not touched a difficulty which was common to both sides.
S2V0006P0_16758,As to the secretary there was no man whose long and meritorious services better entitled him to a liberal remuneration from the country.
S3V0174P0_19177,Grand Jury Reform was equally worthy of his attention.
S4V0110P0_11459,He had no hope at all that this House would lend a sympathetic ear to anything that could be said from the Irish Benches on the subject tonight.
S3V0192P0_23595,"Why, what proof of it is this, that previous to the Poor Law Bill of 1833, the whole property had become well-nigh submerged beneath the parish rate !"
S3V0157P0_25747,Such an enactment as that would never do for England; and the people who entertained such views were not fair judges of this proposal.
S2V0023P0_15475,"In 1827, the expenditure, ordinary and extraordinary, amounted to 92, 200 ."
S4V0044P0_3935,The meaning of that was that the Irish Secretary would listen to every appeal—and God knows there would be plenty appeals made to him—for relief here and there and for jobs of all kinds—[ ironical cheers ]
S4V0104P0_195,I do not see how he can tell.
S3V0117P0_8657,Gentleman the Member for Huntingdon had admitted that he was interested in the growth of coffee in Ceylon and the East Indies; and he (Sir J. Tyrell) begged to tell him that he was interested in the growth of chicory in the county of Essex.
S3V0126P0_12402,"He thought, however, that his courage rather deepened into want of wisdom when he ventured to express suspicions of the motives of others, after the melancholy exposure which he had previously made of his own."
S4V0043P0_2256,"With regard to the cost of the proceedings, he hoped the Lord Chancellor for Ireland, who knew the subject so well, would endeavour to diminish the terrible cost which many of the proceedings threw on both landlord and tenant."
S3V0099P0_13738,"I think that the inquiry which we propose to effect by the Bill introduced in the present Session with respect to certain boroughs in which it is alleged, and indeed has been proved, that elections have been carried by corrupt practices, may give us further information than we now possess as to the character of the freemen, and will enable us to determine whether some boroughs ought to be altogether disfranchised, and whether we ought to adopt, with respect to others, the course which has been taken in the case of Great Yarmouth, namely, that of disfranchising the freemen alone."
S4V0143P0_7364,The facts as to the engineer's examination and reportare substantially as stated.
S3V0299P0_20239,"But upon that ground alone he hoped that the House would not be impatient if, under the circumstances, those who were opposed to the Bill desired somewhat further to discuss some of the questions that were raised on Thursday."
S2V0011P0_7581,"It might be necessary for him, after what he had heard that night, to disclaim all hostility to the dissenters."
S3V0283P0_4570,"He would only add, in conclusion, that he hoped he had succeeded in establishing the fact that in the arguments used by the hon. and learned Member for Kilkenny there were a great many inaccuracies; and he trusted that the House would not be deterred by the threat of factious opposition from conferring on the mercantile community in Ireland the boon which they anxiously anticipated."
S3V0223P0_23379,"Speaker, I regret very much that notice has been taken of the presence of Strangers in this House."
S3V0035P0_15524,"To shew this reluctance of which he complained, he (Mr. Buckingham) would remind the House that some few years ago—in 1830—he submitted the plan of an expedition for exploring the almost unknown regions and coasts of the east of China and the adjacent seas: and when he solicited from the Admiralty the use of two or three of the dismantled and unemployed ships of the navy, then lying idle in the Thames or the Medway, on condition that all the expenses of their equipment should be borne by the merchants and manufacturers of England, and their return to the Admiralty after the voyage guaranteed by the parties fitting them out—the use of these empty ships was refused, though Government would have saved rather than lost by such a step, as every one of them incurs an annual cost to keep them in their present condition."
S4V0010P0_5504,"There had been too much sitting on forms and listening, and too little standing on deck and acting."
S5CV0011P0_25274,"Every mickle makes a muckle, ' and £50 even is important from my point of view."
S3V0181P0_933,"I noticed in the papers of this morning a report of the proceedings in Convocation; and though your Lordships may, perhaps, think that an odd place whence to gain any information respecting the cattle plague, I wish to ask the noble Earl a question bearing upon a statement made by the most rev."
S3V0324P0_10107,"There was a most material fact which was not covered by the evidence at the trial, and which, according to the way it turned out, might show that the verdict was absolutely right or absolutely wrong."
S3V0008P0_3635,He apprehended the land would be liable to Government.
S3V0021P0_3510,"At a period when Government was putting an end to all monopolies, it was singular, that the monopoly of mind alone should remain."
S3V0277P0_4766,"Gentleman whether it was true that, in the case of the Marines brought from England for the maintenance of peace in Dublin, the sergeants received £2 and the men 35 s. a week?—because the pay of a police sergeant in Dublin was not more than 30 a week."
S3V0344P0_9984,"However, I do not think the Amendment can do any harm, and I, therefore, consent to it."
S3V0132P0_11669,All the other colleges were left in a ruck behind.
S3V0011P0_11875,"Since the Resolutions of that House were agreed to in 1823, a correspondence had been carried on by three successive Secretaries of State, for the colonies, who had earnestly endeavoured to impress upon their attention the propriety of adopting the views of Parliament."
S5LV0004P0_12648,"I am, and always have been, a pretty strong individualist."
S4V0123P0_6336,"That is, Canada has about one-eighth of the population and double the wheat area of this country."
S3V0018P0_8414,How much more dangerous to Spain was the continuance of hostilities in Portugal!
S4V0011P0_7023,"T. M. HEALY (Louth, N. ) :"
S3V0061P0_14021,"He answered, """"I have none."
S1V0001P0_10317,"The right hon. gent, required more time to make up his mind."
S3V0161P0_23632,"They say that Victor Emmanuel and M. Cavour, and the noble Lord, robbed the Italian potentates of their dominions."
S3V0356P0_10433,But we know that Mr. Cecil Roche turns up in various counties.
S1V0039P0_4267,"But thinking differently on that point, he felt that from the notoriety of circumstances essentially affecting the question, the House, or rather (he new parliament, might act on the consistency of those principles by which parliament was influenced in the last session, and defer the examination until a more favourable moment, when the course of events should bring about that era at which the legitimate standard of value might be restored without putting to hazard the safety and industry of the country."
S5CV0014P0_2461,"Friend the Home Secretary said this afternoon we shall get to grips upon it as soon as it is possible to do so, and when we are engaged upon that there should be no slackening or intervention of any other issue, however important, until that great and supreme question is brought to a permanent and satisfactory solution."
S3V0007P0_2485,The idea of equalizing the duties on wine was not new.
S2V0004P0_8132,There was indeed a Whig candidate who claimed his support at Carlisle; but was this a sufficient reason for neglecting a duty of this importance on the part of an advocate who feels that there is no sacrifice which he is not bound to make for the interests of his illustrious client?
S4V0083P0_1487,Another question which will have to be considered is that at the present moment there are very few barracks in England where the whole of even a small cavalry regiment could be put up.
S3V0290P0_22698,"It was there stated that the ideal Medical Establishment consisted of 542 appointments, and a Reserve—calculated at 25 percent—of 131, making a total of 673."
S3V0128P0_17667,"Notwithstanding this firm attack, followed by others from other quarters, the Compromise Act passed and was in operation immediately."
S4V0104P0_396,But these men due to leave the colours are not all in South Africa.
S3V0143P0_14516,"The clause, however, was no insertion of his, and he had no wish to press it against the wish of the Committee."
S3V0276P0_12563,But it is not ancient history.
S3V0202P0_202,"My Lords, —My noble Friend (Earl Granville), in the course of his speech, has put one or two questions to me with which, before I enter on the few remarks that I wish to make on the present occasion, I had better deal."
S3V0109P0_6186,"Friend the Member for Oxfordshire, to remove all doubt and ambiguity?"
S3V0145P0_12578,"Gentleman had given him that he was about to bring the subject under the consideration of the House, he had sent for Mr. Page again that morning, but had not been able to see him."
S3V0290P0_4205,He was angry with us for cheering.
S3V0186P0_5534,"Of the three measures before the House this is the only one which contains a substitute for church rate, and is therefore consistent with the decision of a very full House, after ample debate, in 1862."
S3V0171P0_4358,Servia independent of Turkey means Servia dependent upon some other Power.
S2V0002P0_18797,"Exact descriptions had been given in of every species of property; no general or average calculation had been relied on; and although the Parguinotes complained that the sum allotted was unequal to the claims of justice or to their rights, he had not met with a single instance of an individual objecting to the smallness of his own particular share."
S3V0266P0_16629,"He hoped that that Bill would be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, or to a Hybrid Committee as might be found most expedient, and that all the Electric Light Bills would then be referred to the same Committee."
S3V0270P0_15075,The offence most rife in Ireland was that of attacking officers of the law.
S3V0070P0_9189,"Are you sure your opponents have been guilty of the conduct imputed to them?"""""

S3V0281P0_17693,He asks what services Prince Lucien Bonaparte has rendered to the Crown and the country to entitle him to so considerable a grant of money as £250 per annum.
S3V0224P0_17050,"Member of this House, who has hitherto been accepted as an honourable man, as one who respects the Privileges of this House, has somewhat to communicate to the Committee or the House, which it is desirable should not at once be made generally known to the community at large, before the Committee or this House has had the opportunity of considering and probably acting upon it."
S3V0312P0_8139,THE SECRETARY OF STATE (Mr. E. STANHOPE)
S2V0001P0_1082,He thought it therefore necessary to call their attention to the nature of the general distress which formed the ground for their investigation.
S4V0137P0_11579,All these difficulties would be removed by his Amendment.
S4V0083P0_22880,"That is not a question which ought to be submitted to the Railway Commissioners, and I do not think their powers of dealing with the question of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a Rule ought to be limited in that direction."
S3V0051P0_18258,"With respect to the mist, he thought it did not arise from the light, but from the dust which arose from the numerous holes in the floor for the purpose of ventilation."
S4V0116P0_2443,Where was the objection to it?
S3V0344P0_13249,Gentleman some information about the town which I represent—Sunderland.
S4V0132P0_14477,The result of the Rule was that the House might be prevented from discussing questions of the most vital importance by the uncontrolled caprice or design of an individual Member.
S3V0324P0_10979,"But though it is the opinion to which I personally lean, it is not the proposition which at present I wish to urge upon the House."
S3V0092P0_1955,"But, my Lords, it is no such thing."
S3V0047P0_1811,Only false as to the aggravating circumstances.
S4V0119P0_6106,"Why, then, should they not have a centre for a really fine museum in Wales?"
S3V0239P0_13006,"If Her Majesty's Government will consent to that which I really believe to be described in a few words of the despatch—if they will work for the ends of justice and of freedom—if they will be content so far to humble themselves as to work with Europe, and not without or against Europe"
S3V0293P0_2517,Such a course would be received with execration by this country; and foreign nations would regard it with contempt.
S3V0244P0_8568,"That was almost impossible, and he hoped the House would agree to the second reading of the Bill, and allow it to go before a Committee, before whom everyone could have a hearing."
S3V0188P0_12606,It was purchased by a commercial gentleman living in or connected with Belfast.
S3V0039P0_6400,"Had he not read in The Standard a demand upon the Members of its own party to be diligent in attending upon the ballots for election petitions, as """"the old Whigs never attended?"
S3V0227P0_17718,"The first of these was, Had the action of the Legislature in past times with regard to municipal institutions in England and Ireland been identical?"
S4V0119P0_3819,"Let them wait till the Royal Commission has reported, and meantime go back to the status quo ante."
S3V0284P0_12008,Gentleman has not censured the Government for not reconquering the Soudan.
S4V0002P0_26803,"They say they have to sink their capital, and to pay a very much larger rent than if they were leasing the land."
S3V0070P0_17687,"He, therefore, wished that the House would adopt the general principle for the establishment of a secular plan of education, and afterwards to look to the clergy of the various denominations to impart religious instruction to the pupils."
S2V0008P0_19642,"The conduct of the British government is thus fortified by an authority, not interested, not partial, not special in its application; but universal—untinctured by favor—uninfluenced by the circumstances of any particular case, and applicable to the general concerns and dealings of mankind."
S3V0342P0_10816,Gentleman has taken pains to make himself acquainted with the facts.
S3V0157P0_20933,"He declared his belief that the proposals made by Mr. Churchward were of an improper character, yet he admitted that he had never communicated them to the First Lord of the Treasury, nor to any of the officials."
S4V0080P0_18864,"I do not know the exact date on which it was signed, but I understand that the works are to be completed by 30th June, 1903."
S3V0067P0_5637,What would be said of the author of such a transaction in a court of justice?
S3V0150P0_23773,"Gentleman, indeed, appealed to the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton (Viscount Palmerston) and asked whether, if the noble Lord had known the dimensions which this disturbance in India was about to assume, he would have proceeded with his proposed course of legislation."
S3V0332P0_2241,What should be compared is the work the respective Fleets have to do.
S3V0058P0_18385,I lay down no such principle; and I trust no Government will ever consider itself bound by it.
S3V0238P0_22059,"The Parliament House of Dublin was turned over to a banking corporation, while they had not only large sums to keep up Holyrood House, but large sums for all sorts of extensions and additions to it; because it was used for the purposes of the Presbyterians of Scotland."
S4V0144P0_2181,"My noble and learned friend asked me a series of questions as to the constitution of the conference, what members of the Government would represent us, what instructions they would have, and, I think, he even wished to be told how the votes would be taken."
S4V0139P0_16546,"He would much rather lay down a set of rules which he knew to fall short of the actual requirements, but which would still deal with the substantial and main difficulties of the particular trade, than go pottering along year after year, endeavouring by exhortation, advice, and indirect pressure to get people to agree to things to which there was no security that they would permanently adhere."
S3V0314P0_27086,THE SECRETARY OF STATE (Mr. E. STANHOPE)
S4V0032P0_17737,"But the House might be quite sure that if that offence attached to them now someone would have mentioned the fact in the agitation which was going on in reference to that Assembly, but no one appeared yet to have made that accusation against them."

S3V0181P0_9553,"Take the cattle from Ireland, which were landed at Liverpool and elsewhere—they would require to be immediately slaughtered, instead of being at once put into railway trucks, and forwarded to Manchester and other large towns in Lancashire and the manufacturing districts."
S3V0153P0_17941,"To such a proposal the noble Lord, as he says, objected, and he seems to have forgotten that Baron Hummelaur wrote, as the result of his interviews with the noble Lord, and of the impression made upon him by the statements of the noble Lord, that he thought it right to state the principles on the basis of which a new arrangement might be made, and he enclosed that statement of principles, the very first paragraph of which was, that Lombardy should be free and independent, that she should choose her own Government without the control of Austria, if England would consent to settle the affairs of Italy on this basis."
S3V0310P0_743,"The charge of misdemeanour was brought on, and resulted in the counsel stating in public what they had stated to him in private, and a verdict of acquittal being taken."

S3V0169P0_18848,"At one point the thoroughfare was only wide enough to allow two carriages abreast; but while he fully admitted the inconvenience which arose to the public, he could not admit that the Department over which he presided was in the slightest degree responsible for it."

S4V0086P0_9477,Member is going beyond the scope of the Bill.
S3V0189P0_2998,"He scarcely thought it wise, just, or generous at the very moment when the victory had been gained, that they should try to push it to the very furthest and most extreme limit, by proposing such an extensive application of the principle which they had succeeded in establishing in spite of the strong opposition of the Government."
S3V0204P0_15245,"The cost, he might add, of our lunatics, which in 1862 was £482, 000, had advanced in 1869 to £711, 000, so that in a period of seven years it had increased by a sum of £229, 000, or 47 per cent."
S3V0101P0_6563,"At that time it might have been of some use to the Dissenting bodies, because they were small in number in proportion to what they are now; but since that time they have increased both in numbers and wealth, and any one who knows the Dissenting bodies at this moment knows very well that they have now no occasion for this grant."

S4V0175P0_17357,"The grog cost the Admiralty three sixteenths of a penny, and the saving allowed to the men who did not take the rum was nine-sixteenths of a penny, but in their eyes it ought to be more."
S4V0038P0_10957,If the State were to go any further in the direction of abolishing the distinction between the Lord's Day and other days of the week it ought to do so upon some higher ground than that of affording additional comfort and amusement to a fraction of the population at the cost of depriving others of the one holy day of the week which this country alone amongst Christian nations continued resolutely to observe.

S3V0155P0_5000,You ought to make the levy of this tax fall as lightly as you can on the taxpayer; but you are doing what you can to increase the grievance and the burden of it.

S3V0161P0_14971,"But, Sir, if these objections are so strong against immigration to countries in which slavery has been nominally abolished, with how much greater force do they apply to those in which slavery still exists in its most atrocious forms?"

S3V0160P0_1727,"A paper has been laid on your Lordships' table of great importance—no less than the protest of Sir James Outram, who lately occupied the position of President of the Council of India."
S3V0144P0_29459,"If you adopt the proposal of the Government, what sort of an example will you set to future Chancellors of the Exchequer?"
S5CV0014P0_22490,"Therefore there is, undoubtedly, especially in the absence of an official manual of training such as I strongly hold should be issued by the War Office, a great tendency to select ground for the training of Yeomanry regiments over which movements can be practised similar to those carried out by mounted troops during the South African war."

S3V0232P0_17632,"Even Mr. Mill used that argument; but, surely, the reply is simple—you are perfectly justified both in shooting at his body and taking his property as much as you please, provided doing either tends to end the war quickly and satisfactorily to you."
S5CV0014P0_19676,"General Langlois has most eloquently pointed out the extreme difference between this and other countries in that respect, and has shown many points which he thinks are dominant or most important in which we gain enormously by relying upon voluntary services as contrasted with the system of his own country and others."

S3V0085P0_10199,"We have before seen investments made in South American Bonds, and various speculations of the kind; and I should have thought that the result of these speculations would have read a useful lesson to those now engaged in speculation; but the extent of the railway mania has shown that such anticipations of instructions from former losses have not been received; and I do not see any reason to suppose that individual sufferings of any extent or kind will prevent the periodical recurrence of this fever of speculation."
S3V0192P0_1034,Whatever alterations might be necessary in detail—and he admitted that the Bill was susceptible of amendment—
S5CV0001P0_8329,I wish we could be serious.
S5LV0003P0_831,"At the same time, all people who were interested in the question of housing reform were agreed that one of the most difficult things was to find out who really was the owner and who was responsible for a house in an insanitary condition, and there was no doubt at all but that the idea at the root of the Amendment was one which would be very warmly welcomed by a large number of people whose work lay especially in the more crowded districts of our great towns."
S2V0016P0_7122,"We had now five hundred and nine vessels of all descriptions, three hundred and seventy five of which were what were called sixth rates; and the ships laid up in ordinary were, he understood, never in better condition."
S3V0182P0_3309,"Gentleman opposite will not think I am criticizing his Bill in a censorious spirit, because I have done so no more freely than I have performed the same operation on our own Bill of 1860, with respect to its inequality as between the metropolis and the country."

S3V0325P0_24944,"Certainly, in the town of Crewe and the neighbouring villages, where the great works of the London and North-Western Railway Company were situated, there were to be found a large number of railway men."
S3V0336P0_1572,"Again, where we had to deal with firms of shipbuilders whose work may be delayed by a variety of causes, which may interfere with the carrying out of contracts, it became to those administering the Admiralty a matter of great inconvenience if they found themselves bound, on the 31st of March in each financial year, to hand back to the Exchequer sums of money voted by Parliament for the Services of the year, and which the Admiralty had every reason to suppose would be spent in the course of that year, but which, owing to some accident, could not be paid until a few months after the close of the year."
S3V0018P0_5198,He would take the famous Navigation Act as an example.
S3V0164P0_21287,"After what had passed, however, and in accordance with his declaration when the Bill was introduced, it was not his wish to press upon the House at that period of the Session any provisions that might be thought open to objection."
S4V0113P0_1367,"Members who did not consider that full control was given to put down Amendments making that control clearer, stronger and more emphatic, but, instead of seeking to carry out what they had claimed to be their great desire for months past, there was now a Motion to postpone the consideration of the Clause."

S3V0038P0_1297,"He asked if, under such circumstances, the country was in such a state as to justify the Lord-lieutenant in liberating from gaol ninety-six persons?"

S3V0087P0_7573,"These things, if true, demanded the earnest attention of the Government, and formed an additional argument why they should be cautious in passing any such legislative measure as the one now-proposed."
S3V0178P0_22502,"Mitchell was served with the Order of the House at the place of residence known to his employer; hut he was not there, and there could be no doubt that from the time that the Committee sat till the day on which he was brought before them he was purposely keeping out of the way."
S3V0180P0_13359,"Sir, —I have been directed by the Governor General to take every opportunity of explaining to the talookdars the object and limit of the inquiries into rights of occupancy going on, and, as I cannot expect to meet many of you for some months to come, I must have recourse to a letter to give effect to the Governor General's instructions."
S3V0120P0_14753,"The former, instead of rewarding the volunteer with a bounty, allowed his volunteering to count for a year's service, and, in the second place, did not withdraw a man from his locality; while the present Bill obliged him to serve in any part of the Kingdom."

S3V0011P0_5347,"That, whether a town be or be not """"inconsiderable"""" must depend on the facts, and on the actual circumstances, of the place itself, its population, its extent, and its wealth, and not on any arbitrary tests, or ingenious devices, by which such facts may be coloured or concealed, and that no tests can be just and satisfactory which produce different and contradictory results from the same unaltered premises, yet, it appears, that the tests applied to form the schedule under the three Reform Bills, have drawn such different results from the same facts, that the five towns, viz."

S3V0216P0_6595,"He had seen a remonstrance against the Acts which purported to be signed by 1, 500 of the clergy, but, while he felt great respect for the names, he was sorry to be obliged to add that he felt a minimum of respect for their remonstrance, for he thought those gentlemen were taking a very one-sided view of a subject which they did not understand, because, while the Paper professed to deal with the whole subject, it contained no reference whatever to its physical aspect."
S3V0071P0_4290,"On the 1st of August, and in a House which he (Sir J. Graham) almost felt it to be his duty to count—in a House prepared to discuss another subject, the noble Lord proposed by a mere resolution, not by a bill, to abolish a code of laws, which had existed since the time of Edward the 1st to the present day."
S3V0027P0_3,"It stated, that he had been thirty-eight years officiating minister of St. Allen, Cornwall; that he held only a curacy; that no misconduct whatever had ever been charged against him; that a living had become vacant in the bishopric of Exeter; that he had humbly applied for it to the Lord Bishop of that diocese; but that his long services had been passed over, and the living given to another man."
S3V0198P0_7065,"He could not see that there was any difference in principle between rural districts and towns, and the limitation was simply urged, as he understood, upon the ground of the difference between the two in the amount of property at stake."
S5CV0005P0_15663,"What we really want in Ireland is a man who will make something else grow where grass grows now, such as Colonel Everard is doing."
S5CV0013P0_1114,I am anxious that we should preserve the few plantations and trees that we have in Ireland.
S4V0131P0_3815,He thought it would be an exceedingly satisfactory solution of the question.
S3V0345P0_8898,"Members behind him, who so vociferously cheered my question, are clearly of opinion that Her Majesty's Government are on their trial."
S3V0092P0_19236,"That was not the proposal; but it did include an income tax of 5, 000, 000 . to be raised in Ireland; and here he must ask, how much money was now being expended there?"

S3V0138P0_9030,Baronet (Sir J. Hogg) made an objection as to pensions.
S4V0198P0_5941,"He also let us see quite plainly that in his opinion it was a very dangerous thing to give a preference to one part of the country as against other parts and, so far as I was able to gather, he showed a certain preference for accepting the date of 1st January, 1910, for the whole of the collieries."
S5CV0008P0_19664,It is the primary business of the Defence Committee to study and determine what is the best provision that can from time to time be made for the naval and military requirements of the Empire as a whole; to keep both military and naval requirements and their due relation to each other constantly in view.

S3V0124P0_3982,"At all events, if he were ever so untrustworthy—and the more so the better for the argument—the stronger the reason for not excluding that cross-examination, the tendency and inevitable effect of which must be to destroy his evidence by exposing his real character, and thereby to save the property, or the life, or the reputation of the person who was on his trial."
S4V0139P0_3545,"He said, in an epigram not to be forgotten and more true than many epigrams, that this Bill puts the brewer on the bench, puts the justices in the dock, and puts the public out of Court."
S4V0119P0_10952,"Well, what is the reply?"
S4V0198P0_19029,"Then, too, if they had taken up the time of the House they would have been deprived of some, perhaps, of the very many interesting speeches they had had from the Members from the North."

S4V0032P0_19163,What was the object of that Schedule?
S5CV0016P0_26346,"That is, of course, unexampled, and it is an extremely serious matter as diminishing the power of this House to examine carefully the incidence of every tax which is put on."
S3V0182P0_17158,"It was provided that the expense in the first instance should be paid out of the Votes, and that the Exchequer should be recompensed out of the different funds."
S1V0011P0_4336,"What must those feelings have been, when, after all his hope, his anxiety, and fatigue, he had seen the French fleet stealing out of Rochefort unable to follow and defeat them, from the unmerited neglect with which he had been treated."
S4V0054P0_5558,When a decision is arrived at public notification of it will be made.
