8532797,To suggest that the resources of this tremendous institution were not equal to sorting the Irish letters in two and a quarter hours,23,leftward_sent

3935390,To call a state of brigandage that which was the struggle of the Royalists for the Royal cause was merely a clever attempt to give that struggle a bad name.,30,leftward_sent
5537127,That showed that the opposition in Bombay to the licence tax did not originate in any mere selfish impatience of taxation.,21,leftward_sent
6355574,Nor would the Bill be disfranchising in the sense that it would exclude any number of people from having a franchise in the future.,24,leftward_sent

2306732,Gentleman made great complaints against those who had ventured to animadvert on the conduct of the Irish landlords.,18,leftward_sent
10714633,That would not prevent the same course being followed with regard to expressions of opinion by the General Assembly.,19,leftward_sent
7887439,As regards his reductions—though we have thought he might have devoted larger sums to the reduction of indirect taxation instead of giving all his balance to the Income Tax,29,leftward_sent
7072807,But following upon that I certainly take a very strong exception to our being called upon to vote money for this purpose at all.,24,leftward_sent
7665484,Gentleman would not take part in any question if he was interested in it personally.,15,leftward_sent
6536893,Gentleman would grant a Return of all the cases tried at the present Assize?,14,leftward_sent
